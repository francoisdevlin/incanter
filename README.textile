h2. Overview and motivation

_Incanter is a <a href="http://clojure.org">Clojure</a>-based, <a href="http://www.r-project.org/">R</a>-like statistical computing and graphics environment for the JVM._  At the core of Incanter are the <a href="http://sites.google.com/site/piotrwendykier/software/parallelcolt">Parallel Colt</a> numerics library, a multithreaded version of <a href="http://acs.lbl.gov/~hoschek/colt/">Colt</a>, and the <a href="http://www.jfree.org/jfreechart/">JFreeChart</a> charting library, as well as several other Java and Clojure libraries.

The motivation for creating Incanter is to provide a JVM-based statistical computing and graphics platform with R-like semantics and interactive-programming environment. Running on the JVM provides access to the large number of existing Java libraries for data access, data processing, and presentation.  Clojure’s seamless integration with Java makes leveraging these libraries much simpler than is possible in R, and Incanter’s R-like semantics makes statistical programming much simpler than is possible in pure Java.

Motivation for a Lisp-based R-like statistical environment can be found in the paper <i><a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=8Cf16JkKz30C&pg=PA21">Back to the Future: Lisp as a Base for a Statistical Computing System by Ihaka and Lang (2008)</a></i>. Incanter is also inspired by the now dormant Lisp-Stat (see the special volume in the Journal of Statistical Software on <a href="http://www.jstatsoft.org/v13">Lisp-Stat: Past, Present, and Future</a> from 2005).

Motivation for a JVM-based Lisp can be found at the <i><a href="http://clojure.org">Clojure website</a></u></i>, and screencasts of several excellent Clojure talks by the language’s creator, Rich Hickey, can be found at <i><a href="http://clojure.blip.tv/">clojure.blip.tv</a></i>.

h2. Getting started with Clojure

For a great introduction to programming in Clojure, read "Clojure - Functional Programming for the JVM.":http://ociweb.com/mark/clojure/article.html by R. Mark Volkmann. For an even more extensive introduction, get the newly released book "Programming Clojure":http://www.pragprog.com/titles/shcloj/programming-clojure by Stuart Halloway.

h2. Getting started with Incanter

A pre-built version of Incanter that includes all the necessary dependencies can be downloaded <a href="http://incanter.org/downloads/incanter-1.0-SNAPSHOT.zip">here</a>. If you would like to build it from source, read <a href="#build">Building Incanter</a>.

Start the Clojure shell (aka the REPL) from the Incanter directory: @bin/clj@ or @bin\clj.bat@ on Windows (note: if you want to start the Clojure REPL from a directory other than the top level Incanter directory, change the INCANTER_HOME variable in the clj script so that it uses an absolute path instead the ./ directory).

From the Clojure shell, load the Incanter libraries: <pre><code>(use '(incanter core stats charts))</code></pre>

Try an example: sample 1,000 values from a standard-normal distribution and view a histogram: <pre><code>(view (histogram (sample-normal 1000)))</code></pre>

The online documentation for most Incanter functions contain usage examples. The documentation can be viewed using Clojure's @doc@ function. For example, to view the documentation and usage examples for the @linear-model@ function, call @(doc linear-model)@ from the Clojure shell. Use @(find-doc "search term")@ to search the online documentation from the Clojure shell. The API documentation can also be found in the @docs/api/@ directory and online at <a href="http://incanter.org/docs/api">http://incanter.org/docs/api/</a>.

h2. Documentation

The following documentation covers the Incanter and Clojure APIs and the APIs of the underlying java libraries.

<a name="build"></a>

h2. Building Incanter

To build Incanter, test it, and generate the api documentation yourself, run the following commands from the Incanter directory:

* Clone the Incanter Github repository: @git clone git://github.com/liebke/incanter.git@
* cd into the incanter directory
* Download and uncompress Incanter's dependencies: @ant deps@
* Build target/incanter-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar: @ant@
* Run unit tests: @bin/runtests.clj@
* Generate API docs: @bin/generate_docs.clj@

(Note: the @bin/clj@ and @*.clj@ scripts won't run on Windows systems as is. Although, the Clojure code contained in the @*.clj@ scripts can be run from the Clojure shell.)


For back-end processing that doesn't require charts or visualizations, an alternative ant target, called @incanter-core@, is available that creates @incanter-core-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar@, which only includes the 'core' and 'stats' libraries, and only depends on the clojure.jar and Parallel Colt libraries (colt.jar, netlib.jar, arpack-combo.jar).

h2. Building Incanter with Maven

Incanter can be built and tested with Maven with the following commands:
@mvn compile@ to build the incanter.Matrix Java class,
@mvn clojure:compile@ to build the remaining Clojure classes,
@mvn clojure:test@ to run the tests,
@mvn clojure:repl@ to start up a Clojure REPL with Incanter and its dependencies in the CLASSPATH,
@mvn package@ to create a standard Incanter jar file, and an uberjar that includes all of Incanter's dependencies, in the ./target directory.
